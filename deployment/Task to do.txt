Do the following steps everyday.
1. Create a Pod and service having the image rishiwhite11/watchlist-ui:2.2 in 
2. Create a Pod and Service having the image rishiwhite11/watchlist-service:4.1 
3. Create a liveness probe in the pod watchlist UI running the command echo hello world.
4. Create a readiness probe in the pod watchlist-service at the endpoint /readinessProbe/health
5. Run the commands during the runtime npm run start in the same pod.
6. Create a configMap watchlist-config for Pod watchlist-service with the following details
- IEX_API: https://sandbox.iexapis.com
- callback: /api/auth/facebook/callback
7. Create a secret watchlist-secret for Pod watchlist-service with the following details
- clientID: 2343367112542380
- clientSecret: 36b0ec45faa851cf1a8ea174646cbfe8
- token: Tsk_c6e69ff9fe364d209ad3c102508090f2
7.1: create a busybox pod and echo the env variables from secret and configmap
7.2: volume mount all the secrets and configmap inside the watchlist-service pod
8. create a pod and service for mongodb, create volume mount at /data/db
9. Create a PV mongo-pv for mongodb in database namespace.
10. Create a PVC mongo-pvc for the same mongodb pod
11. Check the application is running properly.
12. Create watchlist-ui and watchlist-service deployment and rs and services, and perform rolling update for different version for the UI.
13. Run the watchlist-service Pod as User 1000
14. Create network policy for watchlist application, make sure to use label app:secure-app. Without the UI should not be able to talk to backend.
15. Make sure all the Pods take 100m CPU and 100Mi memory
16. Autoscale the deployment, pods between 5 and 10, targetting CPU utilization at 80%
17. Pause the rollout of the deployment
18. In watchlist-service, run as UID 1000, filesystemgroup 2000, groupID 3000
19. Do the same in busybox
